    <h1>The Great Irish Potato Famine (1845â€“1852)</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Great Irish Potato Famine</strong>, also known as the <strong>Great Hunger</strong>, was a devastating period in Irish history. It began in <strong>1845</strong> when a mold called <strong>Phytophthora infestans</strong> (or P. infestans) caused a destructive plant disease that rapidly spread throughout Ireland. This infestation ruined up to <strong>one-half of the potato crop</strong> that year and approximately <strong>three-quarters of the crop</strong> over the next seven years<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>.</p>

    <h2>Causes and Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cause</strong>: Late blight, a disease that destroys both the leaves and the edible roots (tubers) of the potato plant, was the primary cause of the crop failures. The causative agent of late blight is the water mold <strong>Phytophthora infestans</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact</strong>: Because tenant farmers in Ireland heavily relied on the potato as a source of food, the infestation had a <strong>catastrophic impact</strong> on Ireland and its population. Before it ended in <strong>1852</strong>, the Potato Famine resulted in the death of roughly <strong>one million Irish</strong> from starvation and related causes, with at least another million forced to leave their homeland as refugees<sup>1</sup>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p><strong>Ireland in the 1800s</strong>: After the ratification of the <strong>Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland</strong> in <strong>1801</strong>, Ireland was effectively governed as a colony of Great Britain. The British government appointed Ireland's executive heads of state, known as the <strong>Lord Lieutenant</strong> and the <strong>Chief Secretary of Ireland</strong>. Although Irish residents could elect representation to the British Parliament in London, the majority of elected representatives were landowners of British origin. Additionally, Irish Catholics were initially prohibited from owning or leasing land, voting, or holding elected office under the so-called <strong>Penal Laws</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Land Ownership</strong>: English and Anglo-Irish families owned most of the land, while most Irish Catholics worked as <strong>tenant farmers</strong>, forced to pay rent to the landowners. Ironically, less than 100 years before the Famine, the potato was introduced to Ireland by the landed gentry. Despite only one variety of potato being grown in the country (the so-called "Irish Lumper"), it soon became a staple food for the poor, especially during cold winter months<sup>1</sup>.</p>
